# Crucial Crafting  
## Part 1  

Difficulty Rating: 2  
After the Laestrygonian guards ended their patrol shifts, the captain sailed the ship to the drop zone.

“Before you start the next leg of your journey, there’s something I have to show you. Follow me.”

The captain leads your team down to the ship’s storage compartment, revealing a futuristic submarine, one that must’ve been supplied by the lab. Didn’t the lab say that high-power technological devices would compromise your safety?

“Yes. There were concerns about the signals emitted by such devices, which would have attracted the guardian of Atlantis: the leviathan. A powerful sea-dragon associated with Poseidon himself.”

Oh, that also explains why the captain was so worried about the schedule of the journey. The threat of obliteration by a vast, magical, godly sea dragon would scare anyone.

But if this ‘leviathan’ is the guardian of Atlantis, why isn’t it here right now?

“The beast was deflected by the lab’s diversion: when your mission began, they released a source of low-frequency radio signals in a different region of the ocean. However, I received news that the leviathan started its journey back yesterday. You’ll have to complete your mission quickly.”

The captain activates the submarine. Neon lights illuminate an avant-garde design around the vessel: truly a remarkable piece of engineering.

“The leviathan’s acute senses will surely pick up on the signals emitted by this submarine. It’s been a pleasure working with you. Good luck!”

After you enter the submarine, the captain bids you farewell, and you begin your descent!

What’s this? A note left by the lab team? It says you’ll have to craft some items using the synthesiser built into the submarine. Ah, these items will come in handy when you extract artifacts from Atlantis…

The lab has provided a file containing information about the items that you can craft. Each line represents one item and contains a seven-letter item code, the quality of the item, the cost of producing the item, and the number of unique materials needed to synthesise the item.

According to the note, no pair of items share any materials in common.

You have ample time, so you should probably familiarise yourself with the file.

First, you’ll have to rank the items that you can synthesise. A higher-quality item will always rank higher than a lower-quality item. If two items have equal qualities, then the item with the higher cost will have the higher rank of the two.

Then, find the total number of unique materials used to synthesise the 5 highest-ranking items.

### For example, consider the list of items below as an example:

1 ETdhCGi | Quality : 36, Cost : 25, Unique Materials : 7  
2 GWgcpkv | Quality : 38, Cost : 17, Unique Materials : 25  
3 ODVdJYM | Quality : 1, Cost : 1, Unique Materials : 26  
4 wTdbhEr | Quality : 23, Cost : 10, Unique Materials : 18  
5 hoOYtHQ | Quality : 25, Cost : 15, Unique Materials : 27  
6 jxRouXI | Quality : 31, Cost : 17, Unique Materials : 7  
7 dOXpCyA | Quality : 23, Cost : 2, Unique Materials : 28  
8 LtCtwHO | Quality : 37, Cost : 26, Unique Materials : 29  
9 DLxTAif | Quality : 32, Cost : 24, Unique Materials : 1  
10 XCUJAZF | Quality : 22, Cost : 25, Unique Materials : 29  
11 cwoqgJA | Quality : 38, Cost : 28, Unique Materials : 7  
12 ROPdFSh | Quality : 41, Cost : 29, Unique Materials : 15  
13 iYypXES | Quality : 37, Cost : 12, Unique Materials : 15  
14 srwmKYA | Quality : 48, Cost : 25, Unique Materials : 14  
15 xRbzjOM | Quality : 36, Cost : 20, Unique Materials : 21  


The item with the highest rank has the item code srwmKYA, with a quality of 48 and a cost of 25. This item uses 14 unique materials.
The item with the second-highest rank has the item code ROPdFSh, with a quality of 41 and a cost of 29. This item uses 15 unique materials.
The item with the third-highest rank has the item code cwoqgJA, with a quality of 38 and a cost of 28. This item uses 7 unique materials.
The item with the fourth-highest rank has the item code GWgcpkv, with a quality of 38 and a cost of 17. This item uses 25 unique materials.
The item with the fifth-highest rank has the item code LtCtwHO, with a quality of 37 and a cost of 26. This item uses 29 unique materials.

As no pair of items share any materials in common, then the total number of unique materials needed to synthesise the 5 highest-ranking items is 14+15+7+25+29 = 90. Hence, the answer for this list of items is 90.

Considering your list of items, what is the total number of unique materials needed to synthesise the 5 highest-ranking items?
